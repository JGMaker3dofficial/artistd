# Firmware For JGMaker Artist-D
* Get the inital release of the Firmware: https://github.com/JGMaker3dofficial/artistd/releases/tag/1.1.2


# Curent Status
There is a new Branch, this branch https://github.com/JGMaker3dofficial/artistd/tree/Artist-D_MarlinOverlay is an overlay of the Artist-D customization over the 2.0.X Bugfix Marlin that the Artist-D was based from.   Building this repo (I havn't done it yet) should result in an Identical firmware to the current JGMaker Release.   
This branch contains all the history from the original marlin source.  However, due to some limitations from github having the "Forked from" metadata isn't possible right now.  Nor will it probably be. 

## Getting the Upstram Marlin
There are some instructions here for setting your repository with the upstream Marlin Source. 
https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork

$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations.git

Thie will set an upstream remote that you can fetch and merge from.
